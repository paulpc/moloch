### Where do I start? :traffic_light:

First, checkout the main [Moloch README](README.rst) for information on how to build and run Moloch.

**Then, get some test data!**

* Make sure node 8 is in your path
* Install and Start Elasticsearch
* Use `easybutton-build.sh` or `configure` and `make` to build everything
* Run `make check` from the top level directory, this will
  * run `npm ci` everywhere
  * run `tests.pl` and `tests.pl --viewer` in the tests directory

> **Note:** this will only work if viewer is not already running.

You should now have test data loaded, so let's **start the web app**:

* Move to the Moloch viewer directory
* Run `npm ci`
* Move to the vueapp directory
* Run `npm ci`
* Move back up to the viewer directory
* Run `npm run start:test`
* Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8123`

> :clock1: _On first load, you will likely see this message: "No results or none that match your search within your time range." This is because the data that was loaded is from all time ranges, so make sure you search for ALL times ranges._

For more information about running the Moloch Viewer web application, visit the [viewer README](viewer/README.md).
