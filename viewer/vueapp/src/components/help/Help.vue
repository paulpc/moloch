            Search Bar
          </h3>
          <p>
            Most Moloch tabs have a search bar on the top of the page.
            Moloch uses a very simple query language for building expressions. It
            supports grouping using parenthesis as well as logical AND and OR statements using
            <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code> respectively.
            Fields can be accessed directly using the field names
            and operators described in the
            <a href="help#fields" class="no-decoration">table below</a>.
            Most fields also support a shorthand OR query using square brackets
            using CSV rules to list possible values (<code>field==[item1,item2,item3]</code>).
          </p>
          <p>
            All queries are bounded by a start and stop time. The bounded start and stop times can be
            set either by selecting a choice from a quick relative drop down or by entering exact time sections.
            Since every session has a first packet, last packet, and database timestamp, Moloch offers
            a choice on how to select the sessions:
          </p>
          <dl class="dl-horizontal">
            <dt>First Packet</dt>
            <dd>The timestamp of the first packet received for the session.</dd>
            <dt>Last Packet</dt>
            <dd>The timestamp of the last packet received for the session.</dd>
            <dt>Bounded</dt>
            <dd>Both the first and last packet timestamps for the session must be inside the time window.</dd>
            <dt>Session Overlaps</dt>
            <dd>The timestamp of the first packet must be before the end of the time window AND the timestamp of the last packet must be after the start of the time window.</dd>
            <dt>Database</dt>
            <dd>The timestamp the session was written to the database.  This can be up to several minutes AFTER the last packet was received.</dd>
          </dl>

            <h6 id="stringSearch">
              <span class="fa fa-search"></span>&nbsp;
              String Search
            </h6>
            <p>
              In Moloch, string fields are special since they can be searched in several different
              ways. When fields are indexed, their case may or may not be normalized,
              which is documented in the
              <a href="help#fields" class="no-decoration">fields table below</a>.
              The types of string searches are:
            </p>
            <dl class="dl-horizontal">
              <dt>Wildcard</dt>
              <dd>
                If a <code>*</code> appears in a expression, it is assumed a wildcard
                match is being used. Supported wildcards are <code>*</code>, which
                matches any character sequence (including the empty one), and
                <code>?</code>, which matches any single character. The wildcard query
                is run against the full text strings, after case normalization if
                enabled for the field. For example
                <code>http.uri == "www.f*k.com"</code> will capture an http.uri string
                which contains either www.fork.com or www.frack.com.
              </dd>
              <dt>Regex</dt>
              <dd>
                A regex query must be surrounded by forward slashes and will always be
                anchored. This means you will almost always want to include a leading
                and trailing <code>.*.</code> within your regex query. The regex query
                is run against the full text strings, after case normalization (if enabled) for the field.
                For example <code>http.uri == /.*www\.f.*k\.com.*/.</code> It uses the
                Lucene regex implementation which doesn't support most PCRE features.
              </dd>
              <dt>Lists</dt>
              <dd>
                In Moloch, lists are used as a short hand method for doing multiple OR queries. For example
                <code>protocols == [http,ssh]</code>. This query will search for any sessions containing either http OR ssh.
                <strong>Note:</strong> A list containing wildcard or regex strings will be processed as normal strings instead
                of wildcards and regexes.
              </dd>
            </dl>
            <h6 id="ipSearch">
              <span class="fa fa-search"></span>&nbsp;
              IP Search
            </h6>
            <p>
              IP searching is very flexible and can be performed using the full IP
              address, a partial IP address, or CIDR representation. For fields
              that include a port number, it is possible to follow any of the IP
              representations with a colon (ip4) or dot (ip6) and then the port number to further refine a query. Ports are also
              first class searchable and may be searched for directly. For example:
              <code>ip == 1.2.3/24:80</code>. This query will search for all sessions which contain an IP address within the 1.2.3/24 CIDR range as well as utilizing port 80 during the session.
              An IP search can also be done with list of IPs which may be in mixed representations: <code>ip == [1.2.3.4,1.3/16]</code>
            </p>
            <h6 id="numericSearch">
              <span class="fa fa-search"></span>&nbsp;
              Numeric Search
            </h6>
            <p>
              Numeric fields support simple range operators besides the default equals
              and not equals query types. For example, to show events with bytes transferred being less then 10000,
              use this query: <code>bytes &lt;= 10000</code>.
              Numeric fields also support lists for a simple OR query. For example, <code>port == [80,443,23]</code>
            </p>
            <h6 id="dateSearch">
              <span class="fa fa-search"></span>&nbsp;
              Date Search
            </h6>
            <p>
              Date fields support simple range operators besides the default equals
              and not equals. For example: <code>starttime == "2004/07/31 05:33:41"</code>.
              They also support lists for a simple OR query. For example:
              <code>stoptime == ["2004/07/31 05:33:41","2004/07/31 06:33:41"]</code>.
              However, it's much easier to use the
              <a href="help#timebounding" class="no-decoration">time bounding</a>
              controls under the search bar.
              Finally, relative dates and optional snapping are supported using the
              Splunk syntax:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Begin the string with a plus (+) or minus (-) to indicate the offset from
                the current time.
              </li>
              <li>
                Define the time amount with a number and a unit.
                The supported time units are:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>second:</strong> s, sec, secs, second, seconds
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>minute:</strong> m, min, minute, minutes
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>hour:</strong> h, hr, hrs, hour, hours
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>day:</strong> d, day, days
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>week:</strong> w, week, weeks
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>month:</strong> mon, month, months
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>quarter:</strong> q, qtr, qtrs, quarter, quarters
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>year:</strong> y, yr, yrs, year, years
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Optionally, specify a "snap to" time unit that indicates the nearest
                or latest time to which the time amount rounds down. Separate the time
                amount from the "snap to" time unit with an "@" character.
              </li>
            </ul>

              Field Exists Search
            </h6>
            <p>
              It is possible to check if a field has been set or not in the session by
              using the special comparison value of <code>field == EXISTS!</code> OR negated: <code>field != EXISTS!</code>.
              For example, to verify that a certificate doesn't have an issuer common name, but does
              have a issuer organizational name, the follow query could be used:
              <code>cert.issuer.cn != EXISTS! &amp;&amp; cert.issuer.on == EXISTS!</code>
            </p>
            <h6 id="examples">
              <span class="fa fa-search"></span>&nbsp;

            <p>
              Find all the sessions involving Russia (RU) or China (CN) that are
              using port 80 and also a hostname which contains "com":

            </p>
            <p>
              Find all the sessions of type "text/plain", involving Canada (CA), and
              containing less than 20 packets:

                <code>tags == "http:content:text/plain" &amp;&amp; country == CA &amp;&amp; packets &lt; 20</code>

              The Start box allows a start time/date to be selected. The End box allows an end time/date to be selected.
              The bounding box is used to select where time bounding is applied (last packet, bounded, Session Overlaps, Database)

              Now we arrive at the meat of the Sessions page... Our Session Data! Before we drill into what can be observed within the sessions data, please take note of the column configuration ( <span class="fa fa-th"></span> ) button. By clicking this button an analyst may select
              any field that they wish to observe without opening a session fully by adding it as a column to the table. Predictive typing is also applied within this box. Example: An analyst is only investigating suspicious IRC sessions via the analyst's search query. Instead of drilling into each
              session, that analyst has decided to only show the Start Time, End Time, Src IP, Src Port, Dst IP, Dst Pot, IRC Channel, and IRC Nickname. This column selection tool allows for an analyst to readily view the information which is important to them, configurable per investigation.

            </p>
            <p>
              Viewing the sessions data of a specific network session is as easy as clicking the plus ( <span class="fa fa-plus"></span> ) button to the left of every session. Upon clicking the button, the session drawer will expand giving further context to the session.
              All packet data which was parsed will now be displayed. This includes everything from the user making the connection to the TCP Flags observed during the session.
              If the sessions is HTTP based further data such as Method, User Agents, and Response Headers are readily observable. The extracted Request and Response packet text will also be readily available in either a natural, ascii, utf8, or hex format.
              Furthermore, an analyst can uncompress response data as well as image files which were transferred during the session (be cautious with this option click if investigating sensitive images). Other files (such as mp3s, swf, or js files) may be clicked so that
              they may be downloaded and analyzed when necessary.

            SPI View
          </h3>
          <p>
            The SPI (Session Profile Information) View is used to dive into specific metrics of a session which an analyst wishes to investigate further. Instead of manually writing a query,
            an analyst can hover over field values within the SPI View to add the specific item as an AND or AND NOT to their query. This page also allows an
            analyst a quick view into counts of each item that the user is interested in. As an example, if a analyst wanted to see all BASIC authorization headers that have been recorded
            over the current time window, an analyst could open the http drawer and click to enable the http.authorization field. The analyst could then update their search query to either
            include a specific authorization string which has been observed, or use a wild card to see all of a certain type of authorization header (Basic *, BEARER *, etc). Additionally,
            the SPI View allows an analyst a quick view of observed IP addresses within the time window, http response codes, IRC NICKs/Channels, and much, much more.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Tip:</strong>
            The analyst can save or load the fields that they have displayed/hidden on the SPI View page by clicking the save/load field configuration
            ( <span class="fa fa-columns"></span> ) button.

          </h3>
          <p>
            The SPI Graph page allows a user to visualize, via bar charts over time, any item within the SPI View page. This page is very useful for both at a glance views of activity per SPI type,
            as well as deep dive analysis. For example, if you wanted to chart all of the currently recorded http.users within your current time window, select http.user from the SPI Graph selection typeahead.
            Data will be displayed based upon count of observances over the time period. Increasing the Max Elements setting will allow an analyst to see additional items if the investigates SPI type is noisy.
            An analyst can sort by either the noisiest value (graph) or by alphabetical order (name). This page also has the ability to update every X seconds.

          <p>
            The Connections page allows a user to view a tree force graph based on a source node and destination node of their choosing. Relationships may be visually determined using this method.
            For example, set your Src node to ip.src, Dst node to ip.dst:port and you will be able to visualize the relationship of source IP addresses to destination IP address / port combinations.
            Those who prefer to analyze session data visually may rely heavily on these graphs. The default settings for this page may be set in the settings page.

          </h3>
          <p>
            The Hunt page allows users to search within session packets for text.
            To perform a hunt, users should start by narrowing down their search on the Sessions page.
            Then, switch to the Hunt tab where any new hunt will only search within the sessions searched for earlier.
            Underneath the search bar, the Hunt page will display the number of sessions that will be searched.
            To begin your hunt, click on the "Create a packet search job" button on the top right of the page (under the search bar).
            The form that is presented is described below:
          </p>
            <dl class="dl-horizontal dl-horizontal-wide">
              <dt>Name</dt>
              <dd>The name of the hunt (multiple hunts can have the same name)</dd>
              <dt>Max number of packets to examine per session</dt>
              <dd>The maximum number of packets that the hunt will search within each session</dd>
              <dt>Search</dt>
              <dd>The text to search for (ascii, case sensitive ascii, hex, regex, or hex regex)</dd>
              <dt>Search src/dst packets</dt>
              <dd>Whether to search source or destination packets, or both</dd>
              <dt>Search raw/reassembled packets</dt>
              <dd>Whether to search raw or reassembled packets</dd>
            </dl>
          <p>
            Once the hunt has been created, it will be added to the <strong>hunt job queue</strong>. Hunts run one at a time and
            can be paused so that another hunt can run. After a hunt has completed, it will be added to
            the <strong>hunt job history</strong>. Here, you can rerun a hunt on a different set of sessions, open the
            sessions that matched the hunt, or delete the hunt job from the history.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hunts add <code>huntName</code> and <code>huntId</code> fields to the sessions as they match.
            You can search for these fields in the sessions search bar at any time. Deleting a hunt from the history
            does not remove these fields from the sessions.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Info:</strong> A normal user can only view/pause/delete their own hunts, but an admin can view/pause/delete all hunts.<br>
            <strong>Warning:</strong> The packet search will take a long time and possibly slow down viewer if you search many sessions.
            Users will be alerted if they are trying to search for more than 100,000 sessions. Normal users cannot search more than 1,000,000
            sessions, and admins cannot search more than 10,000,000 sessions (these values can be overwritten in the config).
